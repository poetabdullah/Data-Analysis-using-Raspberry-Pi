# Data Analysis Using Raspberry Pi

## Simple Data Collection and Analysis Project

Welcome to the Simple Data Collection and Analysis Project! This project is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, focusing on efficient data collection and analysis using minimal sensors. Unlike other projects that might use 3-4 sensors simultaneously, our approach aims to simplify handling while ensuring accurate results.

## Key Features

- **Minimalistic Sensor Usage:** The project utilizes a minimal number of sensors for data collection, making it user-friendly and easy to manage.

- **Thorough Testing:** We have conducted extensive testing to ensure the reliability of the project. As a result, the chances of encountering errors are minimal.

- **Data Recording with Python Scripts:** Data is recorded using Python scripts that interact with spreadsheets. This method provides a convenient way to organize and analyze the collected data.

- **Global Accessibility:** Once recorded, the data becomes globally accessible within Raspberry Pi, allowing users to retrieve and analyze it from anywhere through the terminal.

- **Statistical Analysis:** The project employs statistical formulas to provide insights into the parameters of the collected data, offering a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

- **Graphical Representation:** Simple and complex graphs are used to visually represent the data. These graphs offer both an overall perspective and a detailed analysis from different angles.

- **Weather Prediction:** A simple machine-learning model is implemented for weather prediction based on input parameters. This adds a predictive element to the project, enhancing its functionality.

- **Android Application:** To make the project more user-friendly, we have implemented an Android application using Android Studio. The app presents the data in an easily understandable format, incorporating insights gained from the learning practices of the project.
